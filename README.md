# planet-pledge
 tracks how much each person has pledged to public goods 

Planet Pledge – the tiniest public-goods pledge registry
What it does:
Lets anyone pledge an amount (as a public commitment — no token transfer logic here) and keeps a transparent total so communities, countries, or the whole world can coordinate quickly around shared problems.
